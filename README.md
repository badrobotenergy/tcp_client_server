# Rust Client Server App

First go at trying some rust coding outside of a video tutorial I recently watched.

Will use TCP sockets to create a server that will listen on TCP port 3470

The client will be able to connect to TCP port 3470 and have the keystrokes sent to 
the TCP socket instead of stdout.
